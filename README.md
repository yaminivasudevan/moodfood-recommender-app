# MoodFood App

**MoodFood** is a fullstack web application that allows users to:

- Log meals along with their current mood  
- Fetch detailed nutrition data from the **USDA FoodData Central API**  
- Receive **AI-powered recommendations** based on mood, nutritional balance, and psychological impact of food  

Using the **Google Gemini API**, MoodFood doesnâ€™t just suggest random meals â€” it **analyzes the logged food's nutritional content**, **evaluates how that might affect the user's mood**, and recommends **balanced meals** to improve or stabilize emotional wellbeing.

Users can also explore their meal history with advanced filtering, trends, and upcoming features like nutrition analytics and mood-based charts.
